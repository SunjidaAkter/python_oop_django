"""
There are three types of class :
1. class method : a class method is going to affect the actual class 
2. instance method : a instance method is going to affect the actual instance meaning that we can refer to self and the variables inside the instance
3. static method : a static method might or might not be related to the class, it can be used outside or inside and it doesnt have anything rely on from the class itself
