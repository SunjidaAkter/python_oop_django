          <li>
            Variables which are declared with var have function-level scope
            which means they are visible throughout the entire function in which
            they are declared, despite of where they appear within the function.
            If var is declared outside of any function, it becomes a global
            variable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Variables which are declared with let have block-level scope which
            means they are only visible within the block (such as if statements
            or loops) in which they are declared. let provides mutability for
            its value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Variables which are declared with const also have block-level scope.
            If const variables once initialized, it cannot be reassigned to a
            new value. But if the value is mutable (e.g., an array or object),
            the properties of the value can be modified.

          <p>
            Generally we use null to denote intentional absence of value or to
            clear out references and we use undefined for variables or
            properties that have not been assigned a value yet.

          <p><b>REST API :</b></p>
          <p>
            A REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application
            Programming Interface, is a standardized approach which helps
            building web services that enables different software applications
            to communicate with each other throughout the internet. It defines a
            set of rules and conventions for how data should be requested and
            exchanged between clients and servers.
